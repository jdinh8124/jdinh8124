## About Me
Hello, my name is James Dinh, and I am a full stack software engineer currently working in the field who is passionate about development, search engine optimization, accessibility, UX & UI design, and the role of technology in education.

I am a dedicated individual who is passionate about learning and growing in every facet of my professional life. There have been two themes throughout my career, my willingness to lead and my drive to help others succeed. I believe that collaboration and compassion for one another can go a long way in any team. My experiences as a teacher and coach have shaped me into the person I am today, and has led me to my current passion, software development.

Outside of work, I am a proud son, grandson, brother, and uncle. Knowing that I have my family by my side motivates me to improve every single day. Feel free to reach out to me if you are ever in a similar position or would like to connect!
